/*
A Dynamic Memory Allocator(DMA) is  the coding construct that manages the heap portion of a processes virtual memory
a DMA is a tool to allocate memory at runtime. It is usually beneficial to do this since certain variables are not determined until runtime
usually due to user input. Lets say a user wants to store a list of N items(Item[N]), but we only allocated space for M items(Item[M]), where M < N
Our program will need to be recompiled in order for it to work with that data set. or imagine the opposite situation where a program allocated 
Item[N] and the user only provides M items, where M > N, we end up wasting a ton of memory. A DMA allocates the memory need at runtime so we know exactly
how much space we need as the user input of N items becomes known. this is achieved in the C standard library with void *malloc(size_t size) and void free(void *ptr),
functions that allocate a SIZEamount of bytes and free it (when it is no longer needed), respectively. Thanks to virtual addressing the DMA  only has to keep track of
which portions of ITS heap are allocated and free. DMA's also strive to maximize memory utilization(which can be hindered by fragmentation) and throughput 
(which can be hindered by overhead and the algorithm used to find a free block of memory).

Our implementation uses the following to achieve those goals

A) Keep track of Allocated and Free blocks - Implicit Free List DMA implementation 
We maintain an implicit free list that embeds data in the blocks themselves that enable us to distinguish between allocated and free blocks.
Every block has a word-sized header(4 bytes) where the upper 29 bits are used to encode the block size and since the lower 3 bits will never be used for sizing
(due to the fact that every block size must be 8-byte aligned and therefore must be a multiple of 8 - so we'll never need to use bits that provide more precision 
than 8 dec = 1000 bin, (2)*8 = 16 dec = 10000 bin ... etc. notice how the last 3 bits will always be unused since they are NOT a multiple of 8 b/c they are all less than 8).
So we use those bits to convey if a block is allocated or not, where 1 means it is allocated for the LSB and 0 means it is free. 
The rest of the block after the header is the payload which would contain the actual data and possibly some padding to meet that 8-byte alignment requirement.
At the end of the block is also a footer which is identical to the header this enables Bi-directional Coalescing discussed in C).

P = Padding
F = Footer

B) Search Mechanism to find a Free Block  - First Fit Heap Search(IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS AT METHOD)
We use a first fit heap search algorithm to find free blocks to allocate - it simply searches the heap from the beginning until it find an appropriate free block.
it has the advantage that it leaves large free blocks towards the end of the heap so it scores some points with reducing fragmentation. A disadvantage is that the 
start of the list becomes littered with allocated and freed blocks so the search time for a larger free block takes longer. In my opinion it achieves a good balance of 
memory utilization and speed(througput) for an implicit list implementation. the alternative would be Next Fit or Best Fit.

C) Policies to maximize memory utilization - Immediate  Bi-directioanl Coalescing(IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS AT METHOD)
Coalescing is the act of joining adjacent free blocks into one larger free block. The goal is to be aware of the size of our contiguous free blocks in order to more optimally allocate.
We coalesce after every free operation(this is why it is immediate) to make sure adjacent free blocks become one. the footer block enables us to check if the previous block is free

                                           -Immediate Splitting(IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS IN METHOD "PLACE")
whenever we allocate we always(immediate) split the block if the free block has more space then we need. this also maximizes memory utiiization by decreasing internal fragmentation.

/******************HINTS FROM HANDOUT*******************

* Use the mdriver -f option. During initial development, using tiny trace files will simplify
* debugging and testing. We have included two such trace files (short1, 2-bal.rep) that you can use for
* initial debugging.

* Use the mdriver -v and -V options.The -v option will give you a detailed summary for each trace file.
* The -V will also indicate when each trace file is read, which will help you isolate errors.

* Compile with gcc -g and use a debugger. A debugger will help you isolate and identify out
* of bounds memory references.

* Understand every line of the malloc implementation in the textbook.The textbook has a detailed example
* of a simple allocator based on an implicit free list. Use this is a point of departure. Donâ€™t start
* working on your allocator until you understand everything about the simple implicit list allocator.

* Encapsulate your pointer arithmetic in C preprocessor macros. Pointer arithmetic in memory managers
*  is confusing and error-prone because of all the casting that is necessary. You can reduce the complexity
* significantly by writing macros for your pointer operations. See the text for examples

* Do your implementation in stages.The first 9 traces contain requests to malloc and free. The last 2
* traces contain requests for realloc, malloc, and free. We recommend that you start by getting your
* malloc and free routines working correctly and efficiently on the first 9 traces.
* Only then should you turn your attention to the realloc implementation. For starters, build realloc on
* top of your existingmalloc and free implementations. But to get really good performance, you will need
* to build a stand-alone realloc.

* Use a profiler. You may find the gprof tool helpful for optimizing performance

* Start early! It is possible to write an efficient malloc package with a few pages of code.
* However, we can guarantee that it will be some of the most difficult and sophisticated code
* you have written so far in your career. So start early, and good luck!

An application frees a previously allocated block by calling the mm_free function (Figure 9.46), which
frees the requested block ( bp ) and then merges adjacent free blocks using the boundary-tags
coalescing technique described in Section 9.9.11 

The code in the coalesce helper function is a straightforward implementation of the four cases outlined
in Figure 9.40 . There is one somewhat subtle aspect. The free list format we have chosenâ€”with its
prologue and epilogue blocks that are always marked as allocatedâ€”allows us to ignore the potentially
troublesome edge conditions where the requested block bp is at the beginning or end of the heap.
Without these special blocks, the code would be messier, more error prone, and slower because we
would have to check for these rare edge conditions on each and every free request.

in the old block, and the size of the realloc request.The contents of the new block are the same as those of 
the old ptr block, up to the minimum of the old and new sizes. Everything else is uninitialized. 

For example, if the old block is 8 bytes and the new block is 12 bytes, then the first 8 bytes of the new 
block are identical to the first 8 bytes of the old block and the last 4 bytes are uninitialized. 
Similarly, if the old block is 8 byte sand the new block is 4 bytes, then the contents of the new block are
